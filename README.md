# Notepad
## Intro
I developed a Notepad in java with the help of AWT/Swing with event handling to practice my Java programming skills<br>
<br>
I developed following function in this Notepad:
- Users can create new text files and note down the notes.
- Users can open the existing text files
- Users can save the text file on their machine
- Users can also format their test on different font-styles, font-size.

## Compile the project
```
cd src
javac *.java
```
## Run the project
```
java GUI
```
## Note for this project

```setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrane.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)``` is a method used to specify the default close operation for a JFrame.
- This method is typically used to define what happens when the user clocks the close button(the 'X' button) on the window's title bar.
